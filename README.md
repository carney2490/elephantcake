# Elephant Cake

Elephant Cake is an exercise where we are working on user stories.

  - As a user, I want to input a total number of items; so that I can record the number of items.
  - As a user, I want to input the price per item; so that I can accurately record the price per item.
  - As a user, I want to input the 2 alpha character state code; so that I can know the correct state tax.
  - As a seller, I want to know the discount; so that I can apply it to the order.
  - As a user, I want to input a discount if I have recieved one; so that I can apply it to the order.
  - As a user, I want the total price shown before tax; so that I can know how much I will be paying in full before tax.
