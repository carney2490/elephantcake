# Elephant Cake

Elephant Cake is an exercise where we are working on user stories.

  - As a user, I want to input a total number of items and see that echoed back to me; so that I can know the system is responding.
  - As a user, I want to input the price per item; so that I can accurately record the price per item.
  - As a user, I want to input the 2 alpha character state code; so that I can know the correct state tax.
  - As a seller, I want to know the discount; so that I can apply it to the order.
  - As a user, I want to input a discount if I have recieved one; so that I can apply it to the order.
  - As a user, I want the total price shown before tax; so that I can know how much I will be paying in full before tax.
  - As a user, I want the total price shown after tax; so that I can know how much I will be paying in full.
  - As a seller, I want know what state the item was sold to; so that I can pay the apppropriate taxes.
